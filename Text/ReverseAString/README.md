Compile and run ReverseAString.java to use the command prompt UI
    javac ReverseAString.java
    java ReverseAString

Compile and run gui.java to use the Java Swing GUI
    javac gui.java
    java gui
ReverseFuncions.java needs to be in the same folder because gui uses its reversing 
functions which are the same ones as in ReverseAString.java

Both will reverse the string
